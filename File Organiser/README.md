# Simple File Organiser

- checks for files in the working directory
- Sorts them according to either their size or their date modified
- Organises all files in neat folders labelled with their size
- Sorts files according to their date modified in the current working directory

### Installation
Installation is easy. Nothing needs to be installed. I mean the OS library should be there but you already have that, don't you? DON'T YOU!?

#### USAGE
- Keep the `organise.py` file in the directory (folder) containing the files you want to organise.

    #### Running the script
    Open your preferred terminal in the directory you want to organise and type:
    ```
    python3 organise.py
    ```
    
    Choose from the two options to get your files organised.
    
### ACTUAL USAGE
> This was a very simple example of how python can be used to manupulate directories and files. Edit/Add/Remove to the file to make if work FOR YOU. For your needs, add more sizes or add some new type of sort. The program is just a template, the usage is created by you, the user.
